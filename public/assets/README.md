# Exercise GIFs

This directory should contain the exercise demonstration GIFs.

## Required GIFs

Place your exercise GIF files in this directory with the following filenames:

### Back Exercises
- `lat-pulldown.gif`
- `rowing.gif`
- `back-up-machine.gif`

### Leg Exercises
- `barbell-squat.gif`
- `hack-squat.gif`
- `hamstring-curl.gif`

### Chest Exercises
- `incline-press.gif`
- `chest-fly.gif`
- `dips.gif`

### Shoulder Exercises
- `shoulder-press.gif`
- `lateral-raise.gif`
- `reverse-peck-deck.gif`
- `dumbbell-rear-delt.gif`

## Tips

- Use consistent sizing for all GIFs (recommended: 500x500px or larger)
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 5MB each is ideal)
- Ensure good lighting and clear exercise demonstration
- Loop the GIFs to show complete repetitions
- Use smooth frame rates (30-60fps)

## Note

If you don't have GIFs yet, the application will display a placeholder icon instead of the exercise demonstration.
